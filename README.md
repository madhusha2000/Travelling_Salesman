**Project Title: Programming Data Structures and Algorithms Games**

**Description:**
This project consists of a collection of five interactive games developed as part of the Programming Data Structures and Algorithms module. Each game incorporates various data structures, algorithms, and programming techniques learned throughout the course. The games aim to provide both educational value and entertainment, offering players the opportunity to engage with concepts such as recursion, sorting algorithms, graph traversal, and more.

**Games Included:**
1. **Eight Queens Puzzle Game:** A puzzle game where players must place eight chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard without any queens threatening each other. The game utilizes algorithms to find and validate solutions, as well as a threaded approach to compare solution discovery times.

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game:** A classic game where players compete against each other or against the computer in a grid of 3x3 cells. The computer player employs an algorithm to determine optimal moves, while players interact with a user-friendly interface.

3. **Find Shortest Path Game:** A game where players must find the shortest path between cities on a map with randomly assigned distances. The game utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm and provides players with a user interface to input their paths.

4. **Value Index Game:** A game where players must remember the positions of numbers in a sorted list and identify the index of randomly chosen values. The game employs various sorting algorithms and records the time taken for each sorting method.

5. **Predict the Value Index Game:** A game where players predict the index of a randomly chosen value in a sorted list using binary search, jump search, exponential search, and Fibonacci search algorithms. The game records the time taken for each search method.

**Installation Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/5-Games-Made-Using-Programming-Data-Structures-Algorithms
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 5-Games-Made-Using-Programming-Data-Structures-Algorithms
   ```

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).

4. Build and run the project.

**Usage:**
1. Once the project is running, follow the on-screen instructions to interact with each game.
2. For the Eight Queens Puzzle Game, input your queen placements and submit your solution. The system will validate your solution and provide feedback.
3. For the Tic-Tac-Toe Game, make your moves by clicking on the game board. The computer player will respond with its moves, and the game will determine the winner.
4. For the Find Shortest Path Game, input your chosen path between cities and submit. The system will calculate the shortest path and display the result.
5. For the Value Index and Predict the Value Index Games, follow the instructions to identify the index of randomly chosen values in sorted lists.
